name: 'Faster Road Racing: 15k and 10 Miles Schedule 3'
description: '"This schedule is for runners who have been training 55 to 65 miles per week. If you have been running fewer than 55 miles per week, you should follow the schedule for building up to 60 miles per week in chapter 8 before attempting this schedule. This schedule starts at 61 miles per week and gradually builds up to 80 miles with three weeks to go before you goal race. The training then tapers so you are fit and refreshed for race day."'
